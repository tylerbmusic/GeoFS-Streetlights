# Installation process:  
Step 1: Copy the contents of 'userscript.js' into your clipboard  
Step 2: If you haven't already, download tapermonkey (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo//Open)  
Step 3: Press the Extensions icon on the toolbar at the top of your browser and click on the icon that looks like a rounded square with two eyes at the bottom, and press "Dashboard"  
Step 4: Press the little "+" tab, and paste your clipboard contents into the big text box, and click "install".  
Step 5: Open GeoFS, and it should work!  
  
If you _want_ to make your life _harder_, instead of following the installation process, bookmark the userscript.js file and each time you refresh or visit GeoFS, open the bookmark, copy the code, go to the GeoFS tab, press f12, Ctrl+Shift+I, or Cmd+Shift+I, and paste the code into the console.  
  
# Usage  
Streetlights should load in automatically; to disable them, change the render distance, or change the update interval, click on the GeoFS logo with a G at the bottom next to the List of Online Pilots button.
